Metadata for Video Game Preservation - A Literature Review
By: Alejandra Martinez

This .docx file is a preliminary start at a guide for metadata methods and schemas for video game preservation. It is my hope that this guide will be updated continuously over time as new schemas and techniques become available. This literature review is a work in progress that can be used for research/inspiration/a launching pad for media archivists trying to work with video games in their collection. If you find this literature review useful or have any questions/ideas about other schemas to include, feel free to find me on Twitter (@mtzxale) or at my website (https://martinezalejandra.info).
